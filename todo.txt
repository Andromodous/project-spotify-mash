- learn the interface/ type for spotify tracks for type support and safety ✅
- display user data of most listened to songs ✅
- redo the logic flow so users must sign in at first load then access there 'dashboard'
- figure out how to visualize user data 
- explore ways to overcome making many api requests for fetching genre of artists. (redis or batch requests)

mistakes
- I spent a whole day trying to figure out why I keep getting the wrong api data. It was because I was fetching from the wrong endpoint 
- reconsidering my original approach which was fetching from tracks endpoint to atrists endpoint that contains artists genre. artist object in track originally contained genre, but not longer does

- request new credentials from spotify
- test case for when time expires from local storage ✅
